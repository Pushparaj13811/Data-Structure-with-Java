# Data Structure with Java

Welcome to my Data Structure and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey using Java! This repository serves as a record of my progress, containing code, programs, and small projects related to DSA implemented in Java.

## About

In this repository, you will find:

- **Code Snippets:** Examples of various data structures and algorithms implemented in Java.
- **Projects:** Small projects that I'm working on to apply and reinforce my DSA knowledge.
- **Progress Tracking:** I'll be using this space to document my learning milestones and track my progress.

## Learning Goals

My main objectives for this repository are:

1. **Mastering Data Structures:** Understanding and implementing common data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
2. **Algorithms Implementation:** Implementing algorithms for searching, sorting, and solving various computational problems.
3. **Small Projects:** Applying DSA concepts in small Java projects to deepen my understanding.

## Folder Structure

- `src/`: Contains Java source code files for DSA implementations.
- `projects/`: Home to small projects showcasing practical applications of DSA.

## Progress Tracker

I'll maintain a log of my progress, noting completed topics, challenges faced, and insights gained along the way. Check the [Progress.md](Progress.md) file for details.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the code, projects, and progress tracker. If you have any suggestions, improvements, or notice any issues, please open an issue or submit a pull request. I appreciate your feedback!

## Resources

- **Online Courses:** I am following Apna college from youtube and other various online resources.
