```
// Flowcharts & Pseudocodes Code Snippets

// Example code for Flowcharts & Pseudocodes
public class FlowchartPseudocodeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Pseudocode: Read two numbers from the user
        int number1 = getUserInput();
        int number2 = getUserInput();
        
        // Pseudocode: Calculate the sum of two numbers
        int sum = calculateSum(number1, number2);
        
        // Flowchart: Display the result
        displayResult(sum);
    }

    // Pseudocode: Function to get user input
    private static int getUserInput() {
        // Code to read input from the user
        // Replace this with actual code to read input
        return 0; // Placeholder value
    }

    // Pseudocode: Function to calculate sum
    private static int calculateSum(int a, int b) {
        // Code to calculate sum
        // Replace this with actual code to calculate sum
        return a + b; // Placeholder value
    }

    // Flowchart: Function to display the result
    private static void displayResult(int result) {
        // Code to display the result
        // Replace this with actual code to display result
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }
}
```
